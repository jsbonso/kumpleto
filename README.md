# Kumpleto

By Jon Bonso

Just a set of Angular 4 Auto-complete examples that you can use on your projects. 


![Hello GraphiQL API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsbonso/kumpleto/master/autokumpleto_jonbonso.png?raw=true "Autocomplete Angular Example")


A little trivia about the project title: "Kumpleto" is a Filipino word which means "Complete". It is based from the Spanish word: "Completar" and since this is an auto-complete feature example for Angular 4, I named this project as such. 

This project is using ngx-chips so better check this one out as well.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
